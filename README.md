## Project
We're creating a TEI digital edition of a 1773 performance prompt book of William Shakespeare's Timon of Athens. This version of the play was performed at London's Drury Lane/Covent Garden Theatre and has many significant handwritten changes made by either the director or the actors at the time. 

As this is a semester-long project, we are focusing on the very last scene, which contains the most handwritten changes to the printed text (which was already changed to make it a more palatable performance).
